print("""
Your 73% accuracy is MISLEADING because:

1. ‚ùå Validation set is heavily imbalanced (73% Class 0)
2. ‚ùå Model might be predicting Class 0 for everything
3. ‚ùå Or model is good at Class 0 but terrible at Classes 3, 4

To verify, check W&B confusion matrix or class-wise metrics!

Expected per-class accuracy for medical-grade model:
- Class 0: 96%+
- Class 1: 90%+
- Class 2: 92%+
- Class 3: 90%+
- Class 4: 92%+

If your model shows:
- Class 0: 95%+ but Classes 3,4 < 50% ‚Üí Overfitting to majority
- All classes ~73% ‚Üí Model actually learning but val set is biased

SOLUTION: Check confusion matrix in W&B!
