# 20-Epoch Monitoring Checklist (Epochs 60-80)

## 📅 **Epoch-by-Epoch Checkpoints**

### **Epoch 65 Check:**
- [ ] Training loss decreased from current ~3.8?
- [ ] No error messages in logs?
- [ ] Job still running smoothly?

### **Epoch 70 Check (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] **Validation accuracy > 0%?** 
- [ ] Training loss < 3.5?
- [ ] Learning rate still decreasing appropriately?
- [ ] Checkpoint saved successfully?

**🚨 If ALL boxes unchecked → Prepare for Option 2**

### **Epoch 75 Check:**
- [ ] Validation accuracy trending upward?
- [ ] Training loss < 3.2?
- [ ] Consistent improvement visible?

### **Epoch 80 Check (DECISION POINT):**
- [ ] **Validation accuracy ≥ 20%?**
- [ ] **Training loss < 3.0?**
- [ ] Clear upward trajectory established?

**🎯 Decision Matrix:**
- **✅ 2-3 boxes checked**: Continue to epoch 90
- **⚠️ 1 box checked**: Continue with caution
- **❌ 0 boxes checked**: **SWITCH TO OPTION 2**

## 🔍 **What to Look For in Logs:**

### **✅ Good Signs:**
```
Training Batches: XX%|████| Loss=3.2, Acc=0.65, LR=1.8e-05
✅ Validation accuracy: 0.23 (improvement!)
💾 Checkpoint saved to gs://dr-data-2/checkpoints/epoch_070_checkpoint.pth
```

### **🚨 Warning Signs:**
```
Training Batches: XX%|████| Loss=3.9, Acc=0.45, LR=1.9e-05  (no improvement)
Best validation accuracy: 0.0000  (still zero)
⚠️ Loss plateau detected
```

## ⏰ **Timeline Expectations:**

| Epoch | Expected Time | Total Runtime | Check Status |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| 65    | ~8 hours      | ~26 hours     | Light check  |
| 70    | ~10 hours     | ~32 hours     | **CRITICAL** |
| 75    | ~12 hours     | ~38 hours     | Assessment   |
| 80    | ~14 hours     | ~44 hours     | **DECISION** |

---

## 🎬 **Action Plan:**

### **If Epoch 70 Shows Improvement:**
✅ Continue monitoring
✅ Let training run to epoch 90
✅ Expect 90%+ accuracy achievable

### **If Epoch 80 Shows No Progress:**
🔧 Stop current training
🔧 Run: `./optimized_resume_command.sh`
🔧 Switch to aggressive optimization
🔧 Still achievable: 70% chance of 90%+

## 📱 **Quick Status Commands:**

```bash
# Check if training is running
gcloud ai custom-jobs list --region=us-central1 --filter="state:JOB_STATE_RUNNING"

# Get latest logs  
gcloud logging read "resource.type=ml_job" --limit=10 --format="value(textPayload)"

# Check checkpoints
gsutil ls gs://dr-data-2/checkpoints/ | tail -3
```

**Remember: MedSigLIP is a strong foundation model. Even if Option 1 doesn't work perfectly, Option 2 with optimization has excellent chances for 90%+ accuracy!**
